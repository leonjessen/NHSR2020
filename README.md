  - The UK National Health Service is hosting a [virtual R conference
    Nov. 2nd-13th 2020](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/nhs-r-virtual-conference-2020/).
    This workshop is part of the workshop series and was conducted
    Thursday November 5th 2020 09:30 - 13:30 (GMT).

  - The workshop was hosted by [Leon Eyrich
    Jessen](https://rinpharma.com/workshops/leon-jessen/)

## Abstract

This workshop is introductory and open to everyone assuming basic R/Data
Science skills. Please note, the workshop is very hands-on oriented, so
expect to get your fingers dirty\! The aim will be an introduction to
ANNs in R. ANNs form the basic unit of deep learning and are immensely
powerful in predictive modeling, but not without pitfalls. In this
workshop, we will be working with conceptually understanding what an ANN
is, how we train an ANN and how predictions are subsequently made. We
will also touch upon parameters, hyper-parameters and how to handle data
all in context of model over-fitting. All of the aforementioned will be
done using TensorFlow via Keras for R.
