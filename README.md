  - The UK National Health Service is hosting a [virtual R conference
    Nov. 2nd-13th 2020](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/nhs-r-virtual-conference-2020/).
    This workshop is part of the workshop series and was conducted
    Thursday November 5th 2020 09:30 - 13:30 (GMT).

  - The workshop was hosted by [Leon Eyrich
    Jessen](https://rinpharma.com/workshops/leon-jessen/)

## Abstract

The aim of this workshop is an introduction to Artificial neural
networks in R with Keras and TensorFlow. ANNs form the basic unit of
deep learning and are immensely powerful in predictive modeling, but not
without pitfalls. In this workshop, we will be working with conceptually
understanding what an ANN is, how we train an ANN and how predictions
are subsequently made. We will also touch upon parameters,
hyper-parameters and how to handle data all in context of model
over-fitting. The workshop assumes basic R/Data Science skills. Please
note, the workshop is very hands-on oriented, so expect to get your
fingers dirty\!
