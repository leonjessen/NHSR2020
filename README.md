NHS-R Conference Workshop: Artificial neural networks in R with Keras
and TensorFlow
================

## Introduction

This workshop is introductory and open to everyone assuming basic R/Data
Science skills. Please note, the workshop is very hands-on oriented, so
expect to get your fingers dirty\! The aim will be an introduction to
ANNs in R. ANNs form the basic unit of deep learning and are immensely
powerful in predictive modeling, but not without pitfalls. In this
workshop, we will be working with conceptually understanding what an ANN
is, how we train an ANN and how predictions are subsequently made. We
will also touch upon parameters, hyper-parameters and how to handle data
all in context of model over-fitting. All of the aforementioned will be
done using TensorFlow via Keras for R.

Your workshop host for the day will be [Leon Eyrich
Jessen](https://rinpharma.com/workshops/leon-jessen/)
